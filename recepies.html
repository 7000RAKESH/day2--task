      <strong>Nellore Chepala Pulusu -</strong>
      Nellore Fish Pulusu is prepared without adding ginger and garlic. This
      Pulusu is prepared by cooking fish in tamarind juice, tomato and raw mango
      pieces. It is an excellent side dish with boiled rice or Dosas!!!

    <hr />
    <h3 style="color: purple">Fish :</h3>
    <p>
      1.Usually the variety of fish that is used for the Pulusu would be Ravva
      (Indian Salmon), Botcha (Catla/Carp), Korrameenu (Murrel), or Nettili
      (Anchovy). Boneless fish is never to be used in this curry.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.The fish should be fleshy and thick. Otherwise tender slim fish pieces
      tend to disintegrate during the process of cooking itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Many people do not like to eat the fish head. I do not myself relish
      it. But adding eh head pieces to the curry enhances the taste. So the
      suggestion is to cook the head along other pieces, and avoid eating those.
      They can be simply taken as additives that can be discarded.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: purple">Some special tips about the Pulusu:</h3>
    <p>
      1.After following the recipe faithfully, we may find that the salt and
      spice content is unsatisfactory. It could be less or more than necessary.
      It is a good idea to taste the curry at the end of the preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.If we find the curry to be bland because the sourness is less, it is
      better to boil a little Tamarind and adding it to the curry. Give the
      whole curry a boil after this addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.If the sourness is more, it is a good idea to separately cook chilli
      powder and some salt in a little oil and adding to the curry.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: purple">Pulusu Powder:</h3>
    <p>
      1.Roast Rai, Methi seeds, Zeera and Dhaniya seeds and powder the whole.
      Add this powder to the Pulusu at the very end to get that special taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.The powder may be difficult to make if the quantity is too less. A good
      idea is to roast a dry chilli along with the other spices so that grinding
      becomes easier. However you should take care to adjust the Chilli content
      in the main masalas.
